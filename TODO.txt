Make parser exception print out text where parsing was broken (processing line +- 2 nearest lines and command and line numbers)
Prevent parser going into infinity loop

Create Collection class. Rewrite MACRO-APE to use this class.

Create CLI-apps:
-- to merge many files(or whole folder) to a Collection

Make Parsers to be switcheable in runtime so that one could parse string composed of two motifs in different formats.

Decide:
-- Whether PPM should have `words_count`/`weight`?
   PPM format such that parser got both matrix and count (if PPM have `word_count`)
-- can_parse?
-- Whether to cache suffices:  cache :best_suffix, obsolete: [:discrete!, :background!, ...]
